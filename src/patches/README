This directory contains some of the patches that were applied to stock Lua inside the
eLua distribution.

strings_and_protos_in_rom_v1.patch
==================================
DESCRIPTION:
    - Adds the "dm_getaddr" operation which lets a filesystem return the base address 
    of a file (an actual memory address where the file can be found and accessed via
    regular memory read/write operations). Only filesystems that reside in a memory 
    that is directly accesible to the CPU (for example the ROM filesystem inside the 
    MPU Flash memory) can return a non-NULL result for this function and only for files 
    that are contigous in memory (no chained blocks). NULL shuold be returned in all the
    other cases.
    - When loading bytecode from a file that has a base address (dm_getaddr() returns
    a non-NULL result) it keeps the data part of a TString (the string itself) in ROM
    and prevents it from being loaded to RAM. Also keeps the instructions and line size 
    information array of a 'Proto' (function prototype structure) in ROM and prevents
    them from being loaded to RAM.
    - When loading Lua code from a file that has a base address (dm_getaddr() returns
    a non-NULL result) it lets the parser read the Lua code directly from ROM.
